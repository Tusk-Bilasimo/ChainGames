ChainGames
==========

Games associated with blockchains and cryptocurrencies

ABOUT
Chain Games are a fun way to win share and earn DogeParty tokens, firstly there is a reward for the person who correctly completes the crypto puzzle or Game.

When completed correctly, a pass phrase to a rewards wallet is revealed, allowing the participant to sweep the wallet of its tokens.

Hopefully the fun will not end there, winners are encouraged to reseed the wallet with some of their own tokens, leaving them for the next successful player to discover. This we hope will turn the the puzzle into a chain game and the wallet into a "lucky packet" of various DodgeParty tokens.

Thirdly we hope to attract sponsors wishing to promote their projects/services with "ChainAds"; to pay tokens to all who participate. 

The possibility also exists for featured sponsors to award bonus tokens to users who complete their survey questions.

The Idea is to make this an opensource project and attract other comunity enthusiasts to help develop this project.
